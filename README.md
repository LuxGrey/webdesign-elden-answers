# Webdesign Elden Answers

This was a graded university project. The commit history has been altered for the publication on GitHub.

The task was to create a static website with a focus on visual design.

The grading criteria were:

* valid HTML and appropriate positioning of elements
* at least 2 subpages
* sensible print layout
* thoughtful color scheme, typography and logo
* responsive behavior
* consistent design across all pages that also fits the chosen topic and target group
* mandatory canvas animation

I chose to create a mockup for a Q&A-forum around the videogame Elden Ring and called it "Elden Answers".
The intended target group are people who play Elden Ring or have a similar interest in the game.
The layout is heavily inspired by StackOverflow and the color scheme is inspired by various websites related to Elden Ring.
